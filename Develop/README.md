  ## Description: 
  The README.md Generator utilizes the integrated terminal feature of VS Code to produce a README.md file based on user input. User's type their responses in the terminal and a README.md file, with all required elements of a professional document, is created. In this project, I used both Node.js and inquirer to have users prompted with an array of questions, that then are incorporated into a template literal in another file. This project is useful for developers (particularly those who are still learning the required elements of a README), to create professional documents that ensure they meet all their requirements. In the process of creating this project I got more comfortable with creating template literals. In addition, I was able to get a better grasp on all the various licensing types in researching types to include as choices for users. An area I need to grow in is incorporating switch statements, which I am still learning how to have various code blocks read based on user selection. 

  ## Installation: 
  To install this project, you must clone my repository and open the folder in VS Code. Then right click on the index.js file and select "Open integrated terminal". 

  ## Usage: 
  After the terminal pops up, write node index.js and then answer all of the prompts you are asked. After completing all of the prompts a README.md file will be generated among the other files in the folder.
